      <h1>Welcome to the tutorial page!</h1>
      <br>
      
      <p><u>Your goal:</u> Your goal is to collaboratively create, with another player, a certain <u>goal material</u> in-game. Unlike traditional Minecraft, materials here can be made and interacted with in the following ways.</p>

      <p>When you enter the server, you will find there to be a set of blocks already in the environment. These initial blocks are <u>mines</u>: that, when attempted to be destroyed by <u>any tool</u>, will produce a certain new block. Destroying the mine does not remove it; you can continiously create certain blocks this way.</p>

        <center>Figure 1: Mining; Breaking the OBSIDIAN_BLOCK creates a new BROWN_BLOCK</center><br>

      <p>When you click ready on the webpage, you will be presented with your <u>knowledge page</u>. There, you will be presented with information on how to create certain blocks. For example, what certain mines produce will be shown as:</p>

        <center><img src="img/tutorial/examplemining_knowledge.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        <center>Figure 2: Mining, as shown in the Knowledge Page.</center><br>

      <p>In the above image, the BIRCH_PLANK Mine, indicated as such with no border around the icon, can be broken with ANY TOOL. Certain blocks can only be broken with certain tools; for instance, the WHITE_WOOL that the mine produces can only be broken with a GOLDEN_SHOVEL.</p>

      <p>When you enter the server, you will spawn with a set of tools in your inventory.</p>

        <center><img src="img/tutorial/exampletools.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        <center>Figure 3: Example tools that you spawn with; from left to right, IRON_PICKAXE, DIAMOND_PICKAXE, GOLD_PICKAXE</center><br>

      <p>You may move these produced materials by breaking them with a specific tool, which will cause the material to go into your inventory.</p>

        <center><img src="img/tutorial/examplemove.gif" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        <center>Figure 4: Example material move action</center><br>

      <p>To create certain materials not spawned by Mines, you will have to combine materials together by stacking them on top of each other.</p>

        <center><img src="img/tutorial/examplecombine.gif" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        <center>Figure 5: Example material combining; here, stacking a BLUE_BLOCK on top of a WOODEN_PLANK created a BLACK_BLOCK</center><br>

      <p>Similarly, the knowledge page will also present information on how certain blocks combine to make certain blocks. For example, what certain combining actions produce will be shown as:</p>

        <center><img src="img/tutorial/example_knowledge_combine.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        <center>Figure 6: Example material combining knowledge; here, a SOUL_SAND, stacked with a MAGENTA_WOOL, creates a BLACK_WOOL block</center><br>

      <p>Finally, the goal material that you are tasked to collaboratively create will be indicated in the knowledge page by a <u>green border outline</u>, and be listed as a <u>goal material</u> explciitly in its caption. For example:</p>

        <center><img src="img/tutorial/example_goal.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        <center>Figure 7: Example goal block; here, creating YELLOW_WOOL is the goal.</center><br>

      <p>You can create the goal block anywhere in the map; once you do, you and your partner may exit the game.</p>

      <p>During the game, you are asked to perodicially record your beliefs in popups. You will be asked questions about 
        whether certain blocks have been created, and things about your in-game partner. Try to answer them as best as you can as soon as they come up!
        There aren't correct answers, you just need to answer what you think is right at the moment. You need to answer all three questions in order to close the pop-up.
      </p>

        <center>Figure 8: Example questions that pop up perodically</center><br>

      <p>And that's all you need to know! Return to the page and click "I'm Ready" to begin the game and make sure to have a good time!</p>
